- Click the ribbon icon to open the Tablature View.
- Input the string, fret, and note.
- Add notes and rests to the tab based on your selection.
- When you're done, save the tab to an open note
- Bass Tab Buddy keeps your measures organized and properly spaces notes and rests based on your selection.
